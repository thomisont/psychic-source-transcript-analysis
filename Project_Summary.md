# Psychic Source Transcript Analysis Tool - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Psychic Source Transcript Analysis Tool is a Flask-based web application that analyzes call transcripts from ElevenLabs' Conversational Voice Agent for Psychic Source. The application provides a user interface for retrieving, analyzing, and visualizing conversation data.

## Current Status

The application successfully displays mock data for:
- Conversation lists with search functionality
- Detailed conversation transcripts
- Sentiment analysis and topic extraction
- Data visualization using Chart.js

However, it has **not yet succeeded in retrieving real data from the ElevenLabs API**, despite multiple attempts with different endpoint variations and authentication methods.

## Technical Progress Summary

### Completed Work

1. **Application Structure**
   - Built a Flask application with structured routes, API clients, and UI templates
   - Implemented a responsive Bootstrap 5 frontend with Chart.js visualizations
   - Created data processing and analysis modules

2. **Fixed Technical Issues**
   - Changed port from 5000 (which conflicts with macOS AirPlay) to 3000
   - Fixed CORS configuration for API requests
   - Resolved Python dependency compatibility issues
   - Adjusted visualization sizes that were initially too large

3. **UI and Functionality Improvements**
   - Fixed search button functionality on the data selection page
   - Added proper loading indicators and error messages
   - Implemented mock data generation for testing
   - Created data visualizations with sample data

4. **API Integration Attempts**
   - Implemented an ElevenLabs API client with extensive error handling
   - Added support for multiple API endpoint formats and parameter variations
   - Created fallback mechanisms to ensure mock data is displayed when API calls fail

## ElevenLabs API Issues

The application is currently unable to retrieve real data from the ElevenLabs API. The primary error identified is:

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "status": "api_key_with_authorization_header_not_allowed",
    "message": "Only one of xi-api-key and authorization headers must be provided. Received both headers."
  }
}
```

This indicates that our authentication approach is incorrect - we're sending both header types when the API expects only one.

Additionally, all attempted API endpoints return 404 errors, suggesting that:
1. The endpoints we're trying to access may not exist
2. The agent ID might be incorrect
3. The ElevenLabs API may not support the conversation history functionality we need

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12 with Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS with Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js for interactive charts
- **API Integration**: ElevenLabs API with fallback to mock data
- **Deployment**: Local development and Replit compatibility

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Authentication Fix**
   - Update `elevenlabs_client.py` to use only one authentication method:
     ```python
     self.headers = {
         "xi-api-key": self.api_key,
         "Content-Type": "application/json"
     }
     ```
   - Remove the "Authorization" header to prevent the API error.

2. **API Endpoint Investigation**
   - Contact ElevenLabs support to verify if conversation history endpoints exist
   - Confirm the correct agent ID for the Psychic Source "Lily" agent
   - Request API documentation specific to conversation history retrieval

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - If ElevenLabs doesn't provide conversation history API access, consider:
     - Implementing a custom database to store conversation data
     - Creating an interface for manual transcript uploads
     - Integrating with a different API that provides conversation transcripts

4. **Enhanced Mock Data**
   - Further develop the mock data generator to create more realistic conversation data
   - Add more diversity to topics, sentiment patterns, and conversation flows
   - Implement time-based variations to simulate real usage patterns

5. **Deployment Finalization**
   - Complete Replit deployment configuration
   - Add proper error handling for production use
   - Implement user authentication if needed

## Conclusion

The Psychic Source Transcript Analysis Tool has a solid foundation with working UI components and data processing logic. The main barrier to completion is obtaining real conversation data from the ElevenLabs API, which requires either fixing the authentication issues or developing an alternative data source.

The application successfully demonstrates the concept and provides value through its analysis and visualization capabilities. With proper data integration, it could become a powerful tool for analyzing psychic reading conversations and extracting valuable insights.
