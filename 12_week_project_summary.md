# Psychic Source – 12-Week Outcome Recap

_Development cycle: February → April 2025_

---

## Part 1 — Business-Function Capability Journey

| Milestone | What the business can do now |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **1. Unified Data Pipeline** | Live **auto-sync** ingests every new call, stores transcripts in Supabase **SQL _and_ pgvector embeddings** within seconds. |
| **2. Near-Realtime Analytics Dashboard** | Open "Themes & Sentiment" to instantly view overall sentiment, top themes, daily trends, common questions/concerns, & positive-call highlights — all auto-refreshing as the sync feeds data. |
| **3. One-Click Drill-Down** | Every quote, theme or RAG answer deep-links to a **transcript modal** that scrolls + highlights the exact line—no more manual log hunts. |
| **4. Ask-Anything Search (RAG)** | Stakeholders run natural-language queries (e.g.
  "Which calls mention career change last quarter?").  The system performs semantic search + LLM synthesis and returns answers with traceable conversation IDs. |
| **5. Daily Ops Automation** | Background tasks email a **Daily Lily Report** (text + ElevenLabs MP3).  Sync job flags calls missing summaries, queues LLM generation → audit-ready dataset. |
| **6. Future-Proof & Low-Maintenance** | Heavy API work routed through **MCP tools** — tool-makers maintain SDK changes, not us.  Devs spin up locally with `python run.py` in <10 min. |

> **Outcome:** From zero to a self-contained, continuously-updated insight portal that turns raw psychic-call logs into actionable intelligence for marketing, CX and product teams.

## Part 2 — Engineering / Tooling Evolution (Abridged)

| Week range | Key Technical Deliverables |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **0** | Blank slate — no code, no infra. |
| **1-3** | Flask API skeleton, Supabase project & schema, CI pipeline, Replit deployment scripts (`STARTUP.md`). |
| **4-5** | Whisper transcription ETL, sentiment baseline, first unit-test suite. |
| **6-8** | `ConversationAnalyzer`, pgvector search (`match_conversations` SQL), LLM prompt tuning, Redis-style caching. |
| **7-9** | Dashboard 1.0 (sentiment donut, theme bar chart, KPI cards). |
| **9-11** | Advanced insights: accordion categories, positive interaction list, theme↔sentiment correlation, transcript modal. |
| **10-12** | UX refresh (new palette, typography, accessibility), iMessage-style transcript viewer, MCP-tool migration, CSS/JS audit to keep files <300 lines. |

### Rough Spots & Fixes

* Supabase RLS initially blocked batch loader → solved via service-key channel.  
* JWT 302 loop during auth refresh → implemented token-extender middleware.  
* ElevenLabs 403 noise in CI → added health-check & stub fallback.  
* Spinner blocking render → introduced 50 ms defer before heavy Chart.js work.

### Executive Takeaway

We delivered an end-to-end conversation-intelligence platform in **12 weeks**, providing:

* **Realtime visibility** into caller sentiment & themes.
* **Self-service insights** via natural-language RAG queries.
* **Operational efficiency** with automated sync, summarisation & reporting.
* **Future-proof architecture** (Supabase + pgvector + MCP tools) requiring minimal dev-ops overhead.

_Ready for next cycle: CSV/PDF export, proactive alerting, fine-tuned domain-specific sentiment model._
