## Project Reflection (April 9, 2025)

1.  **Core Business Function:**
    *   The application analyzes conversation transcripts (likely sourced from ElevenLabs) to provide insights into sentiment, themes, topics, and user interactions. The primary goal appears to be understanding customer/caller experiences, identifying common issues or questions, and tracking sentiment trends over time, likely for a service like Psychic Source.

2.  **Original Technical Stack & Architecture:**
    *   Python Flask web application.
    *   SQLAlchemy ORM for interacting with a local or traditional PostgreSQL database.
    *   Direct API integrations with ElevenLabs (for conversation data) and potentially OpenAI (for analysis).
    *   Services (`ConversationService`, `AnalysisService`) handling business logic.
    *   Flask routes (`app/routes.py`, `app/api/routes.py`) serving HTML templates and JSON data.
    *   Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, likely using Bootstrap and jQuery, for displaying dashboards and analysis results.

3.  **Supabase Refactoring Initiative:**
    *   **Goal:** Migrate the primary data store from the existing SQLAlchemy-managed database to Supabase (PostgreSQL backend) to improve scalability, reduce direct API load on ElevenLabs, and enable future features like vector search (`pgvector`).
    *   **Strategy:** Implement a hybrid approach during the transition:
        *   Create a new `SupabaseConversationService` to handle interactions with Supabase tables (`conversations`, `messages`).
        *   Modify the data synchronization task (`run_sync_task.py`) to write data to *both* the old database and Supabase.
        *   Refactor application components (API routes, services) to *prioritize* using `SupabaseConversationService` but fall back to the original `ConversationService` if Supabase isn't available or fails.
        *   Inject the appropriate conversation service instance into dependent services like `AnalysisService`.

4.  **Current State & Recent Actions:**
    *   `SupabaseConversationService` has been created and integrated.
    *   The sync task (`run_sync_task.py`) writes to Supabase.
    *   A custom Supabase SQL function `execute_sql` was created to handle specific query needs.
    *   The main Dashboard (`/`) and API Status (`/api/status`) have been updated to use the new service structure and reflect Supabase status. They appear to be working correctly, retrieving conversation counts from Supabase.
    *   `AnalysisService` was refactored to accept a generic `conversation_service` dependency in its `__init__` method, aiming to decouple it from direct database access. Methods within `AnalysisService` (`get_conversation_ids`, `get_conversations_with_transcripts`) were updated to call the injected `conversation_service`.
    *   The application factory (`create_app` in `app/__init__.py`) was updated to inject the primary `conversation_service` instance into `AnalysisService`.
    *   A startup script (`start_supabase_app.sh`) was created to manage dependencies, checks, and server startup.

5.  **Current Challenges & Blockers:**
    *   **Themes & Sentiment Page:** This page (`/themes-sentiment`) remains broken. It fails to load data, showing errors like "Network response was not ok" and JavaScript console errors (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'then')`).
    *   **Service Initialization Errors:** Console logs reveal critical errors during application startup after recent refactoring attempts:
        *   `TypeError: ConversationService.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'db_session'` (Seen at 23:09, 23:17): This indicates that despite efforts to switch to Supabase, the *original* `ConversationService` (expecting `db` or `db_session`) is still being instantiated incorrectly in `app/__init__.py`, likely due to misconfiguration or the application not correctly selecting the Supabase service implementation.
        *   `AttributeError: 'SupabaseClient' object has no attribute 'client'` (Seen at 23:14): This error occurs within the `SupabaseConversationService` when trying to use the `execute_sql` function via the `SupabaseClient` utility. It suggests an initialization or attribute access problem within the `SupabaseClient` wrapper (`tools/supabase_client.py`).
    *   **Inconsistent Service Usage:** The application seems to be struggling to consistently use the intended `SupabaseConversationService`. Routes like `/api/themes-sentiment/data` rely on `AnalysisService`, which *should* be using the injected `SupabaseConversationService`, but the underlying errors suggest either the wrong service is being injected/used or the Supabase service itself has internal errors (`AttributeError`). The logs show `ConversationService initialized (Database Mode)` during startup, confirming the old service is still being activated, likely overriding or conflicting with the intended Supabase integration path for some parts of the app.

6.  **Technical Guidance Summary:**
    *   Continue adhering to PEP 8, type hinting, and clear documentation (docstrings).
    *   Prioritize completing the Supabase migration for data fetching and analysis.
    *   Focus on correctly initializing and injecting the `SupabaseConversationService` throughout the application, ensuring the old `ConversationService` is only used as a fallback if explicitly designed for, or phased out entirely.
    *   Resolve the internal `AttributeError` within the `SupabaseClient` or `SupabaseConversationService`.
    *   Ensure all data-accessing components (routes, services) consistently use the designated service layer (`SupabaseConversationService`).
    *   Maintain comprehensive tests, especially around the service layer and data interactions.
    *   Keep files concise (under 200-300 lines) and refactor where necessary.

# Psychic Source Transcript Analysis Tool

A web application for analyzing call transcripts from ElevenLabs' Conversational Voice Agent for Psychic Source.

## Features

- **Conversation Browser**: View and search through psychic reading conversations
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the emotional tone of conversations
- **Topic Extraction**: Identify key themes and topics discussed
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs showing trends and patterns
- **Export Capabilities**: Export data in JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats

## Architecture

The application uses a service-oriented architecture:

- **Flask Backend**: Handles API requests, data processing, and rendering
- **Service Layer**: Separates business logic from API integration and presentation
- **ElevenLabs API Integration**: Communicates with the ElevenLabs API to retrieve conversation data
- **Analysis Engine**: Processes conversation data to extract insights
- **Responsive UI**: Bootstrap-based interface with Chart.js visualizations
