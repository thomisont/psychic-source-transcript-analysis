### AGENT HAND‑OFF SUMMARY  (2025‑04‑18 21:00 UTC)

1. Context & Goals  
• Consolidate heavyweight‑dependency stubs; stabilise CI tests.  
• Provide guidance for Supabase magic‑link invites to prod domain.

2. Work Completed This Session  
• Centralised all dummy stubs into `tests/conftest.py`; trimmed per‑test hacks.  
• Patched Flask `enforce_login`, AnalysisService, SupabaseClient fakes.  
• Drafted invite workflow (UI steps + optional script) with redirect to `/login`.  
• Updated Project_Summary_Updates.md with prior session log.

3. Outstanding Issues (blocking)  
• A handful of unit tests still failing; error traces pending review.  
• ElevenLabs API status shows false in dev; investigate creds/connectivity.  
• JWT expiry causes repeated 302 loops in logs.

4. New Learnings / Tech‑Stack Notes  
• Supabase Auth invites rely on *redirect URL* whitelist, not call origin.  
• Patching `Flask.before_request` handy for bypassing auth in tests.  
• `.env` already has Supabase keys; scripts can read them directly.

5. Immediate Next Steps (actionable)  
• Decide whether to commit `scripts/invite_users.py` for batch invites.  
• Run full `pytest -q` and catalogue remaining failures for future fix.  
• Add `https://howislilydoing.org/login` to Supabase redirect URLs.  
• Monitor prod logs; plan task to refresh Expo JWT tokens.

### AGENT HAND‑OFF SUMMARY  (2025‑05‑09 17:00 UTC)

1. Context & Goals  
• Initial: Resolve Replit deployment failures (SQLAlchemy init, circular imports).  
• New: Implement UI/backend for human reviewers to add/save notes to conversations (RLHF).

2. Work Completed This Session  
• Traced SQLAlchemy `_all__` error to `analysis_service.py` import timing.  
• Began `analysis_service.py` refactor: added `_get_model_classes()`, commented out deprecated methods.  
• Added `hi_notes` field to `Conversation` model and ran Supabase migration.  
• Updated `SupabaseConversationService` to fetch and save `hi_notes`.  
• Added `hi_notes` textarea and save JS to `transcript_viewer.html` (HTML structure needs manual fix).  
• Created Flask API route `/api/conversations/<id>/notes` to save `hi_notes`.

3. Outstanding Issues (blocking)  
• Replit deployment: Still failing, likely due to incomplete `analysis_service.py` refactor.  
• Replit secrets: `DATABASE_URL`, Supabase keys not persisting in UI; critical platform issue.  
• RLHF UI: `hi_notes` textarea not visible due to HTML error; user needs to apply provided snippet.  
• `analysis_service.py`: Deferred model import needs to be applied to all relevant methods.

4. New Learnings / Tech‑Stack Notes  
• SQLAlchemy `_all__` error likely from `clsregistry.py` inspecting a partially init `sqlalchemy` module.  
• Deferred imports are crucial for breaking Flask model/service circular dependencies.  
• Replit UI bug may be causing newly added deployment secrets to not save reliably.

5. Immediate Next Steps (actionable)  
• User: Manually apply corrected HTML snippet to `transcript_viewer.html` for `hi_notes`.  
• User: Test the "Save Notes" functionality for RLHF.  
• User/AI: Fully refactor `analysis_service.py` with deferred model imports.  
• User: Ensure Replit secrets are correctly set & persist before next deployment attempt.  
• User/AI: Attempt Replit deployment again; analyze logs if errors persist.
