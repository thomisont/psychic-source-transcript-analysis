### AGENT HAND‑OFF SUMMARY  (2025‑04‑18 21:00 UTC)

1. Context & Goals  
• Consolidate heavyweight‑dependency stubs; stabilise CI tests.  
• Provide guidance for Supabase magic‑link invites to prod domain.

2. Work Completed This Session  
• Centralised all dummy stubs into `tests/conftest.py`; trimmed per‑test hacks.  
• Patched Flask `enforce_login`, AnalysisService, SupabaseClient fakes.  
• Drafted invite workflow (UI steps + optional script) with redirect to `/login`.  
• Updated Project_Summary_Updates.md with prior session log.

3. Outstanding Issues (blocking)  
• A handful of unit tests still failing; error traces pending review.  
• ElevenLabs API status shows false in dev; investigate creds/connectivity.  
• JWT expiry causes repeated 302 loops in logs.

4. New Learnings / Tech‑Stack Notes  
• Supabase Auth invites rely on *redirect URL* whitelist, not call origin.  
• Patching `Flask.before_request` handy for bypassing auth in tests.  
• `.env` already has Supabase keys; scripts can read them directly.

5. Immediate Next Steps (actionable)  
• Decide whether to commit `scripts/invite_users.py` for batch invites.  
• Run full `pytest -q` and catalogue remaining failures for future fix.  
• Add `https://howislilydoing.org/login` to Supabase redirect URLs.  
• Monitor prod logs; plan task to refresh Expo JWT tokens.
