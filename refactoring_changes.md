# Psychic Source Transcript Analysis Tool - Refactoring Changes

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Service Layer Implementation
- Created new `services` directory with dedicated service classes:
  - `ConversationService`: Handles fetching and processing conversation data
  - `AnalysisService`: Manages analysis of conversations and sentiment
  - `ExportService`: Handles data export operations
- Services provide a clean separation between data access and business logic

### 2. API Integration Fixes
- Updated ElevenLabs API client to use only the `xi-api-key` header for authentication
- Removed dual authentication approach that was causing API errors
- Improved error handling in API client with better retry logic

### 3. Logging Enhancements
- Replaced print statements with proper structured logging
- Added appropriate log levels (info, warning, error) for better operational visibility
- Implemented consistent logging format across the application

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Added `APITester` utility class for validating API connectivity
- Created `test_api_integration.py` script for easy command-line testing
- Implemented detailed reporting of test results with troubleshooting tips

### 5. Error Handling
- Implemented consistent error handling patterns across the application
- Added proper exception handling in service methods
- Enhanced error reporting in API responses

### 6. Configuration Management
- Fixed NLTK setup process with better error handling
- Improved configuration loading and validation
- Enhanced environment variable handling

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Type Annotations
- Added type hints to method parameters and return values
- Enhanced code readability and IDE support
- Improved maintainability through better defined interfaces

### 2. Documentation
- Added comprehensive docstrings to classes and methods
- Created summary documentation of refactoring changes
- Improved inline code comments for complex logic

### 3. Code Organization
- Improved separation of concerns through service layer
- Reduced code duplication across route handlers
- Simplified complex methods by breaking them into smaller, more focused functions

### 4. Dependency Management
- Fixed missing dependencies in the NLTK setup
- Improved error handling for failed dependency loading

## Performance and Reliability Improvements

### 1. API Communication
- Optimized API request handling with connection pooling
- Improved API endpoint selection logic
- Added more robust fallback mechanisms

### 2. Memory Management
- Reduced memory usage through more efficient data processing
- Implemented streaming for large data exports
- Added proper resource cleanup in exception cases

### 3. Concurrency Handling
- Improved thread safety in shared resources
- Enhanced connection pooling for better performance
