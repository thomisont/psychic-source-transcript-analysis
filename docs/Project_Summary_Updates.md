### AGENT HAND-OFF SUMMARY  (2025-05-06 18:38 UTC)

1. Context & Goals  
• Debug voice overlay; ensure Conversation.startSession works; maintain healthy server env.  

2. Work Completed This Session  
• Patched `voiceSdk.js` to send `authorization` token; avoid dual agentId/signedUrl.  
• Added guard to prevent duplicate handler binding on voice cards.  
• Restarted Flask server per `STARTUP.md`; documented pkill + background start.  

3. Outstanding Issues (blocking)  
• Conversation session still fails to start; root cause (CORS/opts) unresolved.  
• Duplicate voice widgets remain in DOM; excess MutationObserver triggers.  
• Shell attempts to run `run.py` from /home/runner (path mismatch).  

4. New Learnings / Tech-Stack Notes  
• ElevenLabs SDK expects `authorization` header, not `apiKey`; only one of agentId/signedUrl allowed.  
• `voiceObserver` can cause repeated attaches; mark cards with `_voiceBound`.  
• Server must `cd workspace` before `python run.py`; run in bg with &.  

5. Immediate Next Steps (actionable)  
• Inspect network/WebSocket traffic for Conversation.startSession errors.  
• Remove duplicate overlay elements in `base.html`; bind once.  
• Update server start scripts to use correct path; retest mic flow.  
• Clean Permissions-Policy header warnings once functionality stable.
