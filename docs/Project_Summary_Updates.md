### AGENT HAND-OFF SUMMARY (2025-05-08 02:20 UTC)

1.  **Context & Goals**
    *   Primary Goal: Achieve a successful production deployment on Replit.
    *   Secondary Goal: Implement a persistent voice agent drawer that maintains connection across page navigations.
    *   Recent Focus: Debugging Python package dependency conflicts and Flask/SQLAlchemy initialization errors that were causing deployment failures.

2.  **Work Completed This Session**
    *   Resolved multiple package version conflicts in `requirements.txt` (SQLAlchemy, Supabase, python-dotenv, Flask-CORS, NLTK).
    *   Attempted to integrate HTMX for seamless page navigation; reverted due to script re-execution issues.
    *   Restructured `base.html` and `routes.py` to remove HTMX dependencies and revert to standard Flask MPA navigation.
    *   Refactored `voiceSdk.js` multiple times to manage the voice connection state (`window._drawerConvoInstance`) and use event-driven logic for starting/stopping sessions in the drawer.
    *   Corrected `IndentationError` in `app/models.py` by defining the `Agent` class structure.
    *   Updated the deployment command in `.replit` to use Gunicorn: `gunicorn app:create_app()`.
    *   Attempted to fix Flask-Migrate CLI issues in Replit.
    *   Traced deployment errors to SQLAlchemy initialization and circular imports.
    *   Re-verified and confirmed correct structure of `app/extensions.py`.

3.  **Outstanding Issues (blocking)**
    *   **Deployment Failure:** The latest deployment attempt ("Promotion failed") still indicates issues with SQLAlchemy initialization and/or circular imports, specifically:
        *   "Module error: The app is trying to import from `app.models`, but there's an issue with dependencies in SQLAlchemy"
        *   "Attribute error: 'sqlalchemy' has no attribute '__all__' in the imports chain"
    *   **Replit Secrets:** User reports difficulty with deployment secrets (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) persisting in the Replit UI, which is critical for production.

4.  **New Learnings / Tech-Stack Notes**
    *   Flask application structure for SQLAlchemy: `db` object should be initialized in `app/extensions.py`, imported into `app/__init__.py` for `db.init_app(app)`, and then imported by models from `app.extensions`. Model imports in `__init__.py` should occur *after* `db.init_app(app)` and within an app context.
    *   Replit deployment environment can be sensitive to package versions and how build/run commands are configured.
    *   Gunicorn is the target WSGI server for deployment: `gunicorn app:create_app()`.
    *   Persistent drawer with live WebSocket connection across full page reloads in an MPA is very challenging; HTMX/Turbo or an SPA architecture is typically required for true seamlessness.

5.  **Immediate Next Steps (actionable)**
    *   The very next step is to meticulously review `app/__init__.py` and `app/models.py` again to ensure the SQLAlchemy `db` object is initialized and imported in the correct order to resolve the circular dependency and `AttributeError`.
    *   User needs to ensure all required production secrets (especially `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `FLASK_ENV=production`) are correctly and persistently set in the **Replit Deployment Secrets UI**.
    *   After verifying `__init__.py` and `models.py` and deployment secrets, attempt deployment again.

### AGENT HAND-OFF SUMMARY  (2025-05-06 18:38 UTC)

1. Context & Goals  
• Debug voice overlay; ensure Conversation.startSession works; maintain healthy server env.  

2. Work Completed This Session  
• Patched `voiceSdk.js` to send `authorization` token; avoid dual agentId/signedUrl.  
• Added guard to prevent duplicate handler binding on voice cards.  
• Restarted Flask server per `STARTUP.md`; documented pkill + background start.  

3. Outstanding Issues (blocking)  
• Conversation session still fails to start; root cause (CORS/opts) unresolved.  
• Duplicate voice widgets remain in DOM; excess MutationObserver triggers.  
• Shell attempts to run `run.py` from /home/runner (path mismatch).  

4. New Learnings / Tech-Stack Notes  
• ElevenLabs SDK expects `authorization` header, not `apiKey`; only one of agentId/signedUrl allowed.  
• `voiceObserver` can cause repeated attaches; mark cards with `_voiceBound`.  
• Server must `cd workspace` before `python run.py`; run in bg with &.  

5. Immediate Next Steps (actionable)  
• Inspect network/WebSocket traffic for Conversation.startSession errors.  
• Remove duplicate overlay elements in `base.html`; bind once.  
• Update server start scripts to use correct path; retest mic flow.  
• Clean Permissions-Policy header warnings once functionality stable.
